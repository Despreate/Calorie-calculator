        <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_right </span>Dr.
        Fuhrmanâ€™s Nutritarian food pyramid is based on the principles of high
        nutrient eating as illustrated by his Health Equation:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health = Nutrients / Calories (H = N / C)
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_right </span>
        Low-calorie, nutrient dense foods are at the base of the pyramid, and
        high-calorie, nutrient poor foods are at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_right </span>Think of it
        as how much proportionally you should eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_right </span>The food at
        the bottom takes up the most room on the pyramid and it should be the
        foods you eat the most.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_right </span>The nutrient
        poor foods are at the very top, taking up the smallest amount of space
        on the pyramid.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="material-symbols-outlined"> arrow_right </span>These foods
        are the ones you should eat very little of, if any at all.
