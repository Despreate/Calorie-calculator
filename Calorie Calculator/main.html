          <p>
            This Calorie Calculator is based on several equations, and the
            results of the calculator are based on an estimated average. The
            Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest equations used to
            calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy
            expended per day at rest. It was revised in 1984 to be more accurate
            and was used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation was
            introduced. The Mifflin-St Jeor Equation also calculates BMR, and
            has been shown to be more accurate than the revised Harris-Benedict
            Equation. The Katch-McArdle Formula is slightly different in that it
            calculates resting daily energy expenditure (RDEE), which takes lean
            body mass into account, something that neither the Mifflin-St Jeor
            nor the Harris-Benedict Equation do. Of these equations, the
            Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is considered the most accurate equation
            for calculating BMR with the exception that the Katch-McArdle
            Formula can be more accurate for people who are leaner and know
            their body fat percentage.
